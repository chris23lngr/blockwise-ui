# Introduction

## Blockwise UI is a component library inspired by shadcn/ui and uilab. This collection of components is not meant to be a standalone library, but an extension to shadcn/ui for people who want more complex styles.

### Motivation

Another new component library? As if there weren't enough of them already? The answer: Yes, there are! But why build another one? The idea for BlockwiseUI came about while I was working with shadcn/ui. I really liked shadcn/ui's approach of not providing the components as a separate package, but as part of the project. However, the components in shadcn/ui are kept very simple. That's a good thing, because many projects don't need complex components with a special design. The problem that arises from this, however, is that as the popularity of the project grows, many websites look very similar.

The aim of BlockwiseUI is to create a library that makes it possible to create more complex designed components that can be integrated into a project with little effort. The library should be as flexible as possible in order to cover as many use cases as possible. An important goal for this project was that BlockwiseUI's components can be seamlessly integrated with shadcn/ui. This means that BlockwiseUI's components use the same design principles as shadcn/ui and fit into projects as well as possible.
